# Beitbridge Border Traffic Volume Estimating Model

## Introduction
The Beitbridge Border Traffic Volume Estimation Model was developed to analyze and predict traffic flow at the Beitbridge border post, a crucial gateway between South Africa and Zimbabwe. This model is part of a larger initiative by the World Bank aimed at enhancing trade transparency and understanding trade node activities in the Southern African region.

## Project Overview
The model leverages toll station data to provide a detailed count of traffic volumes, aiding in the efficient management and planning of border crossings. By analyzing and predicting traffic flow patterns, the model supports congestion management, urban planning, policy decisions, resource allocation, and real-time updates for navigation systems.

## Data Description
The dataset encompasses traffic count data from 2018 to 2022, recorded at three-hour intervals from two toll stations near Beitbridge. It includes detailed vehicle classification and incorporates economic indicators and fuel prices to enhance the analysis.

## Methodology
The model employs a combination of time-series analysis and machine learning techniques, primarily using the Random Forest algorithm. It also incorporates feature engineering, including lagged traffic volumes and economic indicators, to predict traffic flow accurately.

## Results
The model has demonstrated high predictive accuracy, especially when combining lagged data and historical averages. Comparative analysis with other machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression and Decision Tree models validates the robustness of the Random Forest approach.

## Future Enhancements
The project outlines a roadmap for integrating additional data types and analytical methods to further refine traffic predictions. This includes leveraging historic and real-time traffic data, external factors like weather conditions, and advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques.
