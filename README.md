# Traffic Estimation Model for Beitbridge Border

## Introduction
Traffic congestion at the Beitbridge border between Zimbabwe and South Africa is a critical issue with far-reaching economic and logistical implications. Accurate traffic estimation and prediction are essential for effective management and planning. This project aims to develop a comprehensive Traffic Estimation Model that leverages ground truth data and remote sensing observations to provide real-time traffic flow information.

## Project Objectives
* Explore and preprocess Crickmay Trucks GPS Data.
* Conduct a literature review of traffic flow estimation models.
* Develop a traffic flow model tailored to Beitbridge border characteristics.
* Integrate remote sensing data for improved accuracy.
* Implement data assimilation techniques and regression methods.
* Visualize and document results.
* Present findings through posters and oral presentations.

## Methodology
* Data Exploration and Preprocessing
* Use statistical methods (e.g., histograms) to analyze data distribution.
* Identify and remove erroneous data through visualizations and outlier detection.
* Literature Review and Model Selection
* Conduct an extensive review of traffic flow estimation models from academic sources.
* Select or design a model suitable for Beitbridge border traffic.

## Model Development
* Calibrate the model using ground truth data.
* Integrate remote sensing observations, addressing missing data.
* Employ data assimilation techniques and regression for accurate predictions.

## Documentation and Reporting
* Thoroughly document modifications and code.
* Provide clear instructions for code usage.
* Create a short report following GW University format.
* Prepare visually appealing posters and oral presentations.

## Expected Outcomes
* A robust Traffic Estimation Model tailored to Beitbridge border.
* Real-time traffic flow information for improved border management.
* Comprehensive documentation for code and project findings.

## Conclusion
The Traffic Estimation Model for Beitbridge border is a critical project that addresses traffic congestion issues and contributes to efficient border management. This proposal outlines a structured approach to achieve the project objectives. We believe that this endeavor will have a significant positive impact on the region's transportation infrastructure.
