    "Incorporating stock market data into your traffic estimation model can offer a multi-dimensional perspective on factors affecting traffic flow. Here's how these stocks could be relevant:\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic Indicators: Companies like Anglo American Platinum (AMS.JO) and Harmony Gold Mining (HAR.JO) are closely tied to commodity markets. Their stock prices can reflect broader economic conditions, which in turn could influence cross-border traffic for trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumer Behavior: Retail-oriented stocks like Shoprite Holdings (SHP.JO) and Woolworths Holdings (WHL.JO) could provide insights into consumer behavior. Increased stock prices might correlate with increased consumer activity, potentially affecting traffic patterns, especially during holidays or weekends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial Climate: Banking stocks like Standard Bank Group (SBK.JO) and FirstRand Ltd (FSR.JO) might reflect the overall financial climate. For example, a booming stock could indicate a healthy economy, potentially driving up cross-border business and, consequently, traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Industrial Activity: Barloworld (BAW.JO), being an industrial brand management company, can give insights into industrial activity levels. Increased stock prices might indicate increased industrial activity, possibly affecting cargo traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation with Traffic Metrics: As we've seen in the correlation analysis, some of these stocks show moderate correlation with various traffic metrics, indicating that they could be relevant features for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk Diversification: Using a variety of stocks from different sectors can help diversify the feature set, making the model more robust to changes in any single sector."
